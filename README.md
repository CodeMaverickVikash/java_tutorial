# Java learning project
This project will demonstrate the learning of Java concepts.

### Quick setup:
- **Install Java** - Download and install Java Development Kit (JDK) according to your OS.

- **Set Up a Development Environment** - Choose a code editor or integrated development environment (IDE). Some popular options include:
    - Eclipse: https://www.eclipse.org/
    - IntelliJ IDEA: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/
    - Visual Studio Code (with Java Extension Pack): https://code.visualstudio.com/

- **Verify installation** - 
  - Open a terminal or command prompt.
  - Type ```java -version``` to check that Java is installed.
  - Type ```javac -version``` to check the version of `javac`. 

- **javac:** `javac` is the Java Compiler, a command-line tool provided by the Java Development Kit (JDK) for compiling Java source code files (.java) into bytecode files (.class).

# Java Concepts

Java is a versatile, object-oriented programming language widely used for developing various applications. Here are some key concepts in Java:

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**
   - Java follows OOP principles, including classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

- **Classes and Objects:**
   - Classes are blueprints for creating objects, which are instances of classes defining properties and behaviors.

- **Inheritance:**
   - Allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class, promoting code reuse.

- **Encapsulation:**
   - Bundles data and methods into a class, hiding internal details for better abstraction.

- **Polymorphism:**
   - Objects of different types can be treated as objects of a common type, including method overloading and overriding.

- **Abstraction:**
   - Simplifies complex systems by modeling classes based on essential properties and behaviors.

- **Packages:**
   - Organize classes into namespaces to avoid naming conflicts and provide a modular structure.

- **Exception Handling:**
   - Robust mechanism using try, catch, throw, and finally blocks for effective error management.

- **Interfaces:**
   - Define a contract for implementing classes, containing abstract methods to be implemented.

- **Abstract Classes:**
    - Classes that cannot be instantiated on their own and may have abstract methods.

- **Collections Framework:**
    - Provides classes and interfaces for managing and manipulating groups of objects.

- **Generics:**
    - Enables creating classes, interfaces, and methods operating on types specified at compile time.

- **Multithreading:**
    - Allows concurrent execution of threads for improved performance and handling asynchronous tasks.

- **File I/O:**
    - Classes for reading and writing files, with enhanced capabilities in java.nio package.

- **Java Virtual Machine (JVM):**
    - Compiles Java code into bytecode, executed by the JVM, ensuring platform independence.

- **Annotations:**
    - Provide metadata about the code for configuration, documentation, and code analysis.

- **Lambda Expressions:**
    - Introduced in Java 8, allows concise representation of anonymous functions.

- **Streams API:**
    - Introduced in Java 8, provides a powerful way to process and manipulate collections using a functional programming approach.
